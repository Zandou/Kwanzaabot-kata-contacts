# Contacts database

*Goal: measure performance of a simple application in two scenarios -
with and without a SQL index*

# Step 1 - measure performance without an index

Run the main application with a small number of contacts (<100)
see various readme by languages on how to do that.

You'll get an error message because the code is not complete, so start by implementing the `TODO` comments.

Create a document matching the size of the database with the duration of
the query (in milliseconds):

| size         | time (in ms) |
|--------------|--------------|
| 10           | 0.0 ms       |
| 100          | 0.0 ms       |
| 10,000       | 0.999 ms     |
| 50,000       | 2.999 ms     |
| 100,000      | 6.999 ms     |
| 1,000,000... | 95.085 ms    |
| 10,000,000...| 917.809 ms   |



You'll probably notice the code does not work when n gets big (=~ 1,000,000).

Inserting contacts one by one will be to slow, but inserting 1 million
contacts at once will probably not work either. You'll have to be
smart :)


Make a graph from the table. Does the result match what you would expect ?

# Step 2 - measure performance with an index

Redo the measurements, but this time, create an index *before* inserting the contacts:

```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL
)

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_contacts_email ON contacts(email);
```

Make a graph for the new result. Does it match what you would expect ?
